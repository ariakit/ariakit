<!-- Description -->
Paragraph renders by default as a `<p>` tag with `margin-bottom`.
<!-- Minimal JSX to showcase component -->

```jsx
<Paragraph>
  Popovers are typically dismissable, whether by click on other parts of the
  page or second clicking the popover target (depending on implementation), for
  that reason you can set up a popover to allow you to interact with other
  elements on the page while still being able to read it's content.
</Paragraph>
```

Rendered HTML.

```html
<p class="Base-gxTqDr bCPnxv Paragraph-hHEPzZ gGuRi">
