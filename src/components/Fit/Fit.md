Fit is absolute positioned and takes up all space inside the parent element. It can be used in many ways, as a transparency, as a background, as a layer. By default it doesn't have styling.

```jsx
import { Block } from "reakit";

<Block relative width={50} height={50}>
  <Fit backgroundColor="palevioletred" />
</Block>
```
