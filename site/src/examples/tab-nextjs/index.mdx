import ContentFullWidth from "#app/components/content-full-width.astro";

## Overview

This example demonstrates how to use Ariakit Tab components in a Next.js App Router application. The tabs use folder-style styling with the `ak-tab-folder` class.

## Features

- **Client Components**: The example uses the `"use client"` directive since Tab components require client-side interactivity.
- **Accessible**: Tab components are fully accessible with keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes.
- **Styled**: Uses Ariakit's built-in styling classes for a folder-tab appearance.

## Key Points

When using Ariakit in Next.js:

1. Add the `"use client"` directive to components that use Ariakit's interactive components.
2. Use `useId()` from React to generate stable IDs for default selected tabs.
3. Ariakit components work seamlessly with Next.js App Router.
