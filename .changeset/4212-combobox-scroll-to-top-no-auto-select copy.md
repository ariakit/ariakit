Combobox auto-scroll

The [`Combobox`](https://ariakit.org/reference/combobox) component now scrolls the list to the top while typing when the [`autoSelect`](https://ariakit.org/reference/combobox#autoselect) prop is disabled.

The behavior is now consistent with the [`autoSelect`](https://ariakit.org/reference/combobox#autoselect) prop, except the first item won't be automatically focused.
