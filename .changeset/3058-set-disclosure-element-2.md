Expanding Menubar with focus

Adjacent [`Menu`](https://ariakit.org/reference/menu) popovers will now open when the focus moves through [`MenuItem`](https://ariakit.org/reference/menu-item) elements in a [`MenuBar`](https://ariakit.org/reference/menu-bar). Before, they would only open when another [`Menu`](https://ariakit.org/reference/menu) was already visible.
