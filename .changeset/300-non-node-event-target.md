Components no longer throw on events with a non-element target

Several components attach global event listeners that read `event.target`/`event.relatedTarget` and call methods like `contains()` and `hasAttribute()` on them. When third-party code dispatched an event whose target was a non-element `EventTarget` (such as `window` or an `XMLHttpRequest`), those calls threw a `TypeError`.

This affected [`Dialog`](https://ariakit.com/reference/dialog) (its interact-outside and Escape-to-close listeners), [`HovercardDisclosure`](https://ariakit.com/reference/hovercard-disclosure) (its focusout listener), and the shared `isFocusEventOutside` and `isPortalEvent` helpers used by [`Focusable`](https://ariakit.com/reference/focusable), [`Combobox`](https://ariakit.com/reference/combobox), [`Composite`](https://ariakit.com/reference/composite), and [`Portal`](https://ariakit.com/reference/portal).
