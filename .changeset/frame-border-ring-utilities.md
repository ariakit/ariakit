"@ariakit/tailwind": patch
---

Added frame-related utility aliases and controls in `@ariakit/tailwind`, including `ak-border`, `ak-ring`, `ak-bordering`, `ak-frame-p-*`, `ak-frame-m-*`, `ak-frame-rounded-*`, and `ak-frame-rounded-force-*`, and refined frame context propagation so nested radius, border, ring, and spacing calculations stay synchronized in cover/overflow layouts.
