"@ariakit/tailwind": patch
---

Added new layer utilities and state behavior in `@ariakit/tailwind`, including `ak-layer-level-*`, `ak-layer-current`, and `ak-layer-invert`, and updated layer composition so `ak-layer`, `ak-layer-contrast`, `ak-layer-mix`, and hover/pop utilities can target idle/state/modifier layer channels more predictably across nested contexts.
