Data attributes for duplicate components

The internal logic that identifies duplicate components has been refined. This implies that some internal `data-*` attributes will no longer seep into the rendered DOM elements. If you're doing snapshot tests on the DOM generated by Ariakit components, you should see the `data-command` and `data-disclosure` attributes removed.
