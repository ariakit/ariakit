"@ariakit/tailwind": patch
---

Backported the latest `@ariakit/tailwind` layer and frame utility updates and refreshed the package reference docs so the README matches the current public API, including `ak-layer-level`, `ak-layer-current`, `ak-layer-invert`, `ak-outline`, `ak-border`, `ak-ring`, `ak-bordering`, `ak-frame-p`, `ak-frame-m`, and `ak-frame-rounded` utilities.
