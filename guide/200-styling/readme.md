# Styling

<div data-description>

Ariakit provides unstyled components by default. You're free to style them using your favorite styling method.

</div>

## Applying styles

Ariakit components accept all native props, including `className`, `style`, and `ref`. You can use them to apply your styles just like you would with any other React element using plain CSS, inline CSS, CSS modules, CSS-in-JS, Styled Components, Emotion, Tailwind, etc.

```jsx
<Dialog
  ref={dialogRef}
  style={{ backgroundColor: "white" }}
  className="dialog bg-white"
/>
```

## CSS selectors

<aside data-type="danger" title="Do not use any selectors that are not listed below">

Ariakit renders elements with HTML attributes, such as `role`, that should not be used as CSS selectors as they're not part of the public API and may change in future minor and patch releases.

To safely use CSS selectors, utilize the `className` prop or provide your own `data-*` attributes to the component. Refer to the list below for all the selectors that are safe to use.

</aside>

### `[aria-checked]`

The `aria-checked` attribute is applied to the [Checkbox](/components/checkbox) component when the input is checked. It can be either `true` or `false`.

```css
.checkbox[aria-checked="true"] {
  background-color: hsl(204 100% 40%);
  color: hsl(204 20% 100%);
}
```

### `[aria-disabled]`

Not all HTML elements accept the `disabled` attribute. That's why the [Focusable](/components/focusable) component and all components that use it underneath will apply the `aria-disabled` attribute to the rendered element when the `disabled` prop is set to `true`.

```css
.button[aria-disabled="true"] {
  opacity: 0.5;
}
```

### `[aria-expanded]`

The `aria-expanded` attribute is applied to the [Disclosure](/components/disclosure) component and all components that use it underneath, such as [PopoverDisclosure](/components/popover), [MenuButton](/components/menu), and [Select](/components/select), when the content element is shown.

```css
.button[aria-expanded="true"] {
  background-color: #eee;
}
```

### `[aria-invalid]`

The `aria-invalid` attribute is applied to [Form](/components/form) field components when there's a visible error message. You can use it to style the field differently when it's invalid.

```css
.input[aria-invalid="true"] {
  border-color: red;
}
```

### `[data-active]`

The `data-active` attribute is applied to clickable components, such as [Command](/components/command) and [Button](/components/button), to simulate the `:active` pseudo-class when the components are not rendered as native `button` elements.

It's important to note that, to avoid doing unnecessary work, the `data-active` attribute is not applied to components that are rendered as `button` elements. Therefore, you should use both the `:active` and `[data-active]` selectors to keep your styles consistent.

```css
.button:active,
.button[data-active] {
  background-color: #eee;
}
```

### `[data-active-item]`

The `data-active-item` attribute is applied to composite widget items when they receive focus or are hovered (when the [`focusOnHover`](/reference/composite-hover#focusonhover) prop is set to `true`). Besides the [Composite](/components/composite) component itself, composite widgets include [Combobox](/components/combobox), [Menu](/components/menu), [Radio](/components/radio), [Select](/components/select), [Tab](/components/tab), and [Toolbar](/components/toolbar).

This attribute is also applied to the [`Combobox`](/reference/combobox) component when it's the only active item in the composite widget. In other words, when no [`ComboboxItem`](/reference/combobox-item) is active and the focus is solely on the combobox input. In this case, you can use this selector to provide additional affordance to users who pressed <kbd>↑</kbd> on the first item or <kbd>↓</kbd> on the last item to place both virtual and actual DOM focus on the combobox input.

```css
.item[data-active-item] {
  background-color: #eee;
}
```

### `[data-autofill]`

The `data-autofill` attribute is applied to the [Select](/components/select) component when it's used within a form and the value has been autofilled by the browser.

```css
.select[data-autofill] {
  background-color: rgb(219 237 255);
}
```

### `[data-backdrop]`

The `data-backdrop` attribute can be used to style all [Dialog](/components/dialog) backdrop elements at once.

```css
[data-backdrop] {
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```

### `[data-open]`

The `data-open` attribute is rendered on [Disclosure](/components/disclosure) components when the content element is shown. It's similar to [`data-enter`](#data-enter), but it's applied synchronously. This is equivalent to the `open` attribute applied to native disclosure elements.

This is handy for applying CSS animations to the content element. For [CSS transitions](/tags/css-transitions), you should use [`data-enter`](#data-enter) instead.

```css
.dialog[data-open] {
  animation: fade-in 200ms;
}

@keyframes fade-in {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

### `[data-enter]`

When [Disclosure](/components/disclosure) components are displayed, they assign the `data-enter` attribute to the rendered element. This occurs after a brief delay, allowing the browser to paint the starting style of the element before the transition begins.

```css
.dialog {
  transform: scale(0.9);
  transition: transform 200ms;
}

.dialog[data-enter] {
  transform: scale(1);
}
```

### `[data-leave]`

Similar to [`data-enter`](#data-enter), [Disclosure](/components/disclosure) components will apply the `data-leave` attribute to the rendered element when it's being hidden. This only occurs if an enter transition or animation was detected.

Typically, when using [CSS transitions](/tags/css-transitions), [`data-enter`](#data-enter) is all you need. The CSS transition will reverse when the element is hidden. However, if you want to style the exit transition differently, or prefer to use CSS animations, you can use `data-leave` for this purpose.

```css
.dialog {
  transform: scale(1);
  transition: transform 200ms;
}

.dialog[data-leave] {
  transform: scale(0.9);
}
```

### `[data-focus-visible]`

The `data-focus-visible` attribute is applied to the [Focusable](/components/focusable) component and all components that use it underneath when there's a keyboard interaction on a focusable element.

It works the same way as the [`:focus-visible`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible) pseudo-class. However, unlike `:focus-visible`, the `data-focus-visible` attribute is also applied to composite widget items, such as [ComboboxItem](/components/combobox), when they receive [`virtualFocus`](/reference/use-composite-store#virtualfocus).

If you're styling Ariakit components, it's recommended to use the `[data-focus-visible]` selector to keep your styles consistent.

```css
.button[data-focus-visible] {
  outline: 2px solid #007acc;
}
```

### `[data-user-value]`

The `data-user-value` attribute is used on the `span` elements within [`ComboboxItemValue`](/reference/combobox-item-value) that correspond to the user's input. This is handy when you need to emphasize the matching segment of the item value.

```css
[data-user-value] {
  background-color: #eee;
}
```

### `[data-autocomplete-value]`

The `data-autocomplete-value` attribute is applied to the `span` elements within [`ComboboxItemValue`](/reference/combobox-item-value) that do not correspond to the user's input. In other words, these are the sections of the item value that act as autocomplete suggestions.

```css
[data-autocomplete-value] {
  color: #aaa;
}
```

## CSS variables

Some components, such as [Popover](/components/popover), [Menu](/components/menu), [Hovercard](/components/hovercard), [SelectPopover](/components/select), [ComboboxPopover](/components/combobox), among others, expose CSS variables that you can use to customize their appearance.

### `--popover-anchor-width`

The `--popover-anchor-width` variable exposes the width value of the anchor element. It's useful when you want to make the popover element have a minimum or the same width as the anchor element.

```css
.combobox-popover {
  /* The combobox popover will have the combobox input width as its min width */
  min-width: var(--popover-anchor-width);
}
```

### `--popover-available-height`

The `--popover-available-height` variable exposes the available vertical space in the viewport. You can use this to make the popover element have a maximum height that fits the available space.

```css
.popover {
  max-height: var(--popover-available-height);
}
```

### `--popover-available-width`

The `--popover-available-width` variable exposes the available horizontal space in the viewport. You can use this to make the popover element have a maximum width that fits the available space.

```css
.popover {
  max-width: var(--popover-available-width);
}
```

### `--popover-overflow-padding`

The `--popover-overflow-padding` variable exposes the amount of padding that should be added between the popover element and the viewport edges. You can use this in combination with `100%` or `100vw` values to make the popover element fill the entire viewport width, while still keeping the padding.

```css
.popover {
  width: calc(100vw - var(--popover-overflow-padding) * 2);
}
```

### `--popover-transform-origin`

You can adjust the transform origin value of the popover element using the `--popover-transform-origin` variable. This comes in handy when you're animating the popover element and need the transform origin anchored to the anchor element.

```css
.popover {
  transform-origin: var(--popover-transform-origin);
}
```

### `--scrollbar-width`

The [Dialog](/components/dialog) component will define a `--scrollbar-width` CSS variable on the `html` element when a modal dialog is open. Since the scrollbar is hidden when a modal dialog is open, this variable can be used to adjust the right padding of your `position: fixed` elements.

```css
.header {
  position: fixed;
  padding-inline: 16px;
  padding-inline-end: calc(16px + var(--scrollbar-width, 0));
}
```
