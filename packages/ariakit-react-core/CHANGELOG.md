## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Removed extra `console.log` from `Hovercard`.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Updated package names to include the `@ariakit` scope, providing a more distinct and specific namespace for our packages.

  Additionally, we've made a change to the versioning system, moving from `v2.0.0-beta.x` to `v0.x.x`. This alteration means that although the library is still in beta, we can release breaking changes in minor versions without disrupting projects that don't set exact versions in their `package.json`.

  ```diff
  - npm i ariakit
  + npm i @ariakit/react
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Packages are now ESM by default (commonjs modules are still available with the `.cjs` extension).

- Updated dependencies: `@ariakit/core@0.1.0`.
