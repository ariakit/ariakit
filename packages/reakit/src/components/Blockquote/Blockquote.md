By default it renders as a `<blockquote>`.

```jsx
<div>
  <Blockquote>
    Freedom means the opportunity to be what we never thought we would be.
  </Blockquote>
</div>
```

Basic styling via props:

```jsx
<Blockquote borderLeft="2px solid darkgrey" color="black" fontStyle="italic">
  Freedom means the opportunity to be what we never thought we would be.
</Blockquote>
```
