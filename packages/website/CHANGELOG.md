# [1.0.0](https://github.com/reakit/reakit/tree/master/packages/website/compare/website@1.0.0-rc.2...website@1.0.0) (2020-05-12)

# [1.0.0-rc.2](https://github.com/reakit/reakit/tree/master/packages/website/compare/website@1.0.0-rc.1...website@1.0.0-rc.2) (2020-04-29)

**Note:** Version bump only for package website





# [1.0.0-rc.1](https://github.com/reakit/reakit/tree/master/packages/website/compare/website@1.0.0-rc.0...website@1.0.0-rc.1) (2020-04-20)


### Features

* Replace `unstable_animated` by `animated` with improvements on the API ([#616](https://github.com/reakit/reakit/tree/master/packages/website/issues/616)) ([16f843f](https://github.com/reakit/reakit/tree/master/packages/website/commit/16f843f8dc4b97a552d629bd41cf20107e307a77)), closes [#528](https://github.com/reakit/reakit/tree/master/packages/website/issues/528)


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **This should affect only people who were using the `unstable_animated` API**: `DisclosureContent` and its derivative components don't add `hidden` class anymore. You should now use `[data-enter]` and `[data-leave]` selectors. For more details, see [Animating](https://reakit.io/docs/disclosure/#animating).





# [1.0.0-rc.0](https://github.com/reakit/reakit/tree/master/packages/website/compare/website@1.0.0-beta.16...website@1.0.0-rc.0) (2020-03-30)


### Features

* Add `Clickable` component ([#596](https://github.com/reakit/reakit/tree/master/packages/website/issues/596)) ([6a9fca9](https://github.com/reakit/reakit/tree/master/packages/website/commit/6a9fca9f20f1e93eb93776577607d5577d6f5870))
* Select the first `Tab` by default and don't require `stopId` prop ([#597](https://github.com/reakit/reakit/tree/master/packages/website/issues/597)) ([528b016](https://github.com/reakit/reakit/tree/master/packages/website/commit/528b016304f381b171cdc96598201deb54fb53c8))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* The first `Tab` is now selected by default. There's no need to pass `selectedId` to `useTabState` anymore.

  If you're already using `selectedId` to select a tab in the initial render, you don't need to change anything as this still works. But, if you want to render tabs with none selected, you should now pass `null` to `selectedId`:

  ```js
  // if you're already using selectedId, there's no need to change anything
  const tab = useTabState({ selectedId: "tab-1" });
  ```

  ```diff
  // when there's no tab selected by default, you now need to explicitly specify it
  - const tab = useTabState();
  + const tab = useTabState({ selectedId: null });
  ```
* **Most users will not be affected by this**, but `stops`, `register` and `unregister` on the returned object of state hooks have been renamed to `items`, `registerItem` and `unregisterItem`, respectively.

  ```diff
  const tab = useTabState();
  - tab.stops.map(...);
  + tab.items.map(...);
  - tab.register(...);
  + tab.registerItem(...);
  - tab.unregister(...);
  + tab.unregisterItem(...);
  ```
* `Tabbable` doesn't trigger a click on the element when pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> and <kbd>Space</kbd> anymore. If you need that feature, use `Clickable` instead.

  **Before:**
  ```jsx
  import { Tabbable } from "reakit/Tabbable";
  <Tabbable />
  ```
  **After:**
  ```jsx
  import { Clickable } from "reakit/Clickable";
  // Tabbable is not going away, it just doesn't represent a clickable element
  // anymore
  <Clickable />
  ```
