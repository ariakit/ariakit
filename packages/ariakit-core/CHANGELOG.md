# @ariakit/core

## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- [`#2935`](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2935) Fixed TypeScript declaration files in CommonJS projects using `NodeNext` for `moduleResolution`.

- [`#2945`](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2945) Added new `disabledFromProps` function to `@ariakit/core/utils/misc`.

- [`#2948`](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2948) Added `"use client"` directive to all modules.

- Improved JSDocs.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- [`#2909`](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2909) Fixed [Disclosure](https://ariakit.org/components/disclosure) and related components not waiting for the exit animation to complete before hiding the content element.

- Improved JSDocs.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- Improved JSDocs.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [`#2801`](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2801) Fixed `values.slice` error that would occur when clicking on `FormCheckbox` that uses an integer-like field name.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`#2783`](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2783) **BREAKING** _(This should affect very few people)_: The `select` and `menu` props on `useComboboxStore` have been removed. If you need to compose `Combobox` with `Select` or `Menu`, use the `combobox` prop on `useSelectStore` or `useMenuStore` instead.

- [`#2745`](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2745) Component stores will now throw an error if they receive another store prop in conjunction with default prop values.

### Patch Changes

- [`#2782`](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2782) Fixed form store not synchrozining validate and submit callbacks with another form store through the `store` property.

- [`#2783`](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2783) Component store objects now contain properties for the composed stores passed to them as props. For instance, `useSelectStore({ combobox })` will return a `combobox` property if the `combobox` prop is specified.

- [`#2785`](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2785) Added `parent` and `menubar` properties to the menu store. These properties are automatically set when rendering nested menus or menus within a menubar.

  Now, it also supports rendering nested menus that aren't nested in the React tree. In this case, you would have to supply the parent menu store manually to the child menu store.

  These properties are also included in the returned menu store object, allowing you to verify whether the menu is nested. For instance:

  ```jsx
  const menu = useMenuStore(props);
  const isNested = Boolean(menu.parent);
  ```

- [`#2796`](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2796) Composed store props such as `useSelectStore({ combobox })` now accept `null` as a value.

## 0.2.9

### Patch Changes

- [`#2709`](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2709) Fixed `addGlobalEventListener` function when used in a document with sandbox iframes.

## 0.2.8

### Patch Changes

- Removed private properties from the store object. ([#2706](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2706))

  Instead of accessing `store.setup`, `store.sync`, `store.subscribe`, etc. directly, use the equivalent functions exported by the `@ariakit/core/utils/store` module.

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- Added new `EmptyObject` type export to `@ariakit/core/utils/types`. ([#2553](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2553))

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- Fixed `defaultItems` passed to the collection store being overriden when new items are added. ([#2559](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2559))

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- Added new `disclosure` prop to the `Disclosure` store. ([#2518](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2518))

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- Added missing `types` field to proxy package.json files. ([#2489](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2489))

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- Added `.cjs` and `.js` extensions to paths in proxy package.json files to support bundlers that can't automaically resolve them. ([#2487](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2487))

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Updated the `SelectPopover` component so the `composite` and `typeahead` props are automatically set to `false` when combining it with a `Combobox` component using the `combobox` prop from the select store. ([#2428](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2428))

  This means you'll not need to explicitly pass `composite={false}` when building a [Select with Combobox](https://ariakit.org/examples/select-combobox) component.

- Updated `getScrollingElement` function so it also considers horizontal scrolling elements.

- Fixed `StringWithValue` utility type.

- Fixed `activeId` state on `Tab` not updating correctly when setting `selectedId` with the Next.js App Router. ([#2443](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2443))

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Fixed `useHovercardStore` and `useTooltipStore` not updating the state when the `timeout`, `showTimeout` or `hideTimeout` props changed. ([#2421](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2421))

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- **BREAKING**: Moved props from the `usePopoverStore` hook to the `Popover` component: `fixed`, `gutter`, `shift`, `flip`, `slide`, `overlap`, `sameWidth`, `fitViewport`, `arrowPadding`, `overflowPadding`, `getAnchorRect`, `renderCallback` (renamed to `updatePosition`). ([#2279](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2279))

  The exception is the `placement` prop that should still be passed to the store.

  **Before**:

  ```jsx
  const popover = usePopoverStore({
    placement: "bottom",
    fixed: true,
    gutter: 8,
    shift: 8,
    flip: true,
    slide: true,
    overlap: true,
    sameWidth: true,
    fitViewport: true,
    arrowPadding: 8,
    overflowPadding: 8,
    getAnchorRect: (anchor) => anchor?.getBoundingClientRect(),
    renderCallback: (props) => props.defaultRenderCallback(),
  });

  <Popover store={popover} />;
  ```

  **After**:

  ```jsx
  const popover = usePopoverStore({ placement: "bottom" });

  <Popover
    store={popover}
    fixed
    gutter={8}
    shift={8}
    flip
    slide
    overlap
    sameWidth
    fitViewport
    arrowPadding={8}
    overflowPadding={8}
    getAnchorRect={(anchor) => anchor?.getBoundingClientRect()}
    updatePosition={(props) => props.updatePosition()}
  />;
  ```

  This change affects all the hooks and components that use `usePopoverStore` and `Popover` underneath: `useComboboxStore`, `ComboboxPopover`, `useHovercardStore`, `Hovercard`, `useMenuStore`, `Menu`, `useSelectStore`, `SelectPopover`, `useTooltipStore`, `Tooltip`.

  With this change, the underlying `@floating-ui/dom` dependency has been also moved to the `Popover` component, which means it can be lazy loaded. See the [Lazy Popover](https://ariakit.org/examples/popover-lazy) example.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- Updated `isFocusable` function to return `false` when the element is `inert` or is a descendant of an `inert` element. ([#2339](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2339))

- Fixed build target. ([#2355](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2355))

- Updated JSDocs.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- Updated JSDocs.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Added support for native radio buttons within forms, that work with roving tabindex, to all `focus` utilities. ([#2313](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2313))

- Updated validate and submit callbacks on `Form` so they always run in a consistent order. ([#2319](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2319))

- Marked internal store functions as deprecated/experimental. ([#2316](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2316))

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Added `isFalsyBooleanCallback` method.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Added missing `defaultValue` prop back to `useRadioStore`. ([#2265](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit/pull/2265))

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Updated package names to include the `@ariakit` scope, providing a more distinct and specific namespace for our packages.

  Additionally, we've made a change to the versioning system, moving from `v2.0.0-beta.x` to `v0.x.x`. This alteration means that although the library is still in beta, we can release breaking changes in minor versions without disrupting projects that don't set exact versions in their `package.json`.

  ```diff
  - npm i ariakit
  + npm i @ariakit/react
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Packages are now ESM by default (commonjs modules are still available with the `.cjs` extension).
